# Learnings from the December 2025 Gamejam at Ulm University

This document should serve as a simple collection of learnings from the hackathon.
Feel free to address any aspect of the event (team work, tech stack, pitch/presentation, etc.),
but please be considerate in your phrasing and refrain from assigning blame!

## What went well?

- We were able to create a functioning co-op game in just two days
- People seemed to like the idea and enjoy playing in a team
- Inventory/crafting system

## What went wrong?

- We had no novel idea
- We would need someone who can help with the art style
- We were missing a proper storyline/art direction
- Problems with old Godot version and package management under Ubuntu
- Missing tutorial and key hints made it hard for players to understand the game
- Handling VCS conflicts in Godot scenes is annoying and costs a lot of time

## What did we learn/enjoy seeing from other teams?

- Creative ideas (forklift game, https://itch.io/jam/hackathon-x-gamejam-2025-2/rate/4119831)
- Beautiful artstyle (frog game, https://itch.io/jam/hackathon-x-gamejam-2025-2/rate/4119813)
- Coding a functioning app that uses bluetooth, P2P Wifi and NFC in a weekend is possible nowadays

## What would we do differently next time?

- Learn to use tile maps properly in Godot
- Learn to structure projects in Godot
- A library of common functionalities (player controls, score board, etc.) or templates would help with rapid prototyping
- Improve on collision handling
